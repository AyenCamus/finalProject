#Binary Search Algorithm Visualization
----
## by Adrienne Camus

###About
> In this visualization of a binary search function, the computer will try to find a given number in a range of numbers. It'll start by finding the halfway point in the range, and then will check to see if the given number is less than or more than that point. If the "mystery number" is in the lower half, it will stop searching the upper half, and vice versa. The process will be repeated, and the range will become smaller and smaller until the "mystery number" is found (i.e. until it is equal to the halfway point, rounded down if it's not a whole number.)

###Usage
> 1. Enter a number from 1 - 100
2. Watch a visual representation of a binary search algorithm
3. Enter a new number, if desired
